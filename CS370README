- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  - I was given the framework for a treasure hunt game using Q-Learning techniques to teach the agent to play the game.  I created the section for Q-Learning.
- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  -  AI and machine learning is being utilized more and more, so knowing at least the basics of how it works allows one to create things that accompany AI and machine learning even if one is never near a witch.
- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  -Like engineers who build buildings, we as computer scientists build buildings out of technology, effectively.  We have a responsibility to keep that in mind for our future generations too.
- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  -I tend to take a break, get my head on straight again, and come back to look at the probolem with fresh eyes.
- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  -+I could wax poetic about this for days but to make a long story short, our ethical responsibilities lie especially in what we make and how our bias affects the program.
