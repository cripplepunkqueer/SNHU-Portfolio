Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- Artemis Financial is a financial company that creates financial plans for clients.  Their services range from retirement to investments to savings.  Secure communications is vital for a business such as this, as the information the company handles is deeply sensitive – tax ID’s, Social Security Numbers, the list goes on.    They wished for better security for their international and national banking plans.


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
- I believe I did best in recognizing patterns that allowed me to examine things better in terms of coding.  It is important to code securely because more oft than not, a company is working with deeply sensitive and private information and software security not only adds trust but a level of protection from liability.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
- Well, truth be told the main challenge was working through my severe carpal tunnel - but I did find it challenging that often my problems wound up being that I had a file in the wrong directory!  But it's good now that I know because I can include that in my troubleshooting.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
- In general, I tend to approach things by assuming only one path of things is not the way I want to go.  Ideally, security should be like birth control - more than one method is the best. 

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- I troubleshot my code as I went to catch any problems quickly and then tested it repeatedly through debugging and maven dependency checks!

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Google is a huge help in trying to navigate understanding basic concepts.  I have ADHD so sometimes I just need something explained to me in a different way and so often I will search just to gain a proper understanding of said thing, and I will continue finding that practice helpful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
- The vulnerability assessment report shows a proficiency in examining for vulnerabilities and coming up with security ideas which I would like to show!
