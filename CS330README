How do I approach designing software?
  * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    * I have a better comprehension of thinking about code in 3D
  * What design process did you follow for your project work?
    * Where I didnt understand things, I did nmy best to find other ways the content was explained so I could better understand it.
  * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    *The troubleshooting tactics are imperative as is handling my anxiety when I cannot figure something out.
How do I approach developing programs?
  * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    * Game development is not my track so - I used a lot of new development strategies.  Most of this class was new development strategies, honestly!
  * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    * I feel like I actually started out strong but wound up faltering when I put everything together.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    * Problem solving skills as well as learning how to think better in 3D are going to do me well in the future classes I have!
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    * See above, but applied to my hope to go into User Experience.  User Interfaces can often involve 3d aspects and knowing about those is incredibly important.
