Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The Client is DriverPass, a driver's ed service.  They wanted a new system to be able to fill a void 
  in the market to train students for DMV driving tests

What did you do particularly well?
  I think I was very good at catching any potential accessibility issues!
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think my chart work could be better, but I'm not entirely sure how I'd improve that.  
  But I intend to keep that in mind as I go forth in my education.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider 
the user’s needs when designing?
  As a user of systems like this myself, I put myself in the user's shoes.  It's pretty easy to then implement that into the system design, of course -
  and the user's needs are important because at the end of the day they're the ones who will be using this!
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  The techniques and strategies I use really ultimately depend on the software itself as there is no one cookie cutter way to go about this.
