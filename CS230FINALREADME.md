Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company with a history of success in launching a puzzle game on Android.  They reached out for help in expanding their game across all platforms and devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel like I adapted and learned better as time went, as I did not understand it starting out thanks to outside circumstances in life.  I also believe I made a good case for cloud storage as well!

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Viewing the model as a UML class diagram helped me understand the structure of the different components of the app and how they related to each other, which helped me better code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
My beginning work, I would have liked to put more effort and focus into Project One and the beginning journals.  I definitely was not doing my best due to illness and feel I could have just overall done better, make those projects a little more cohesive.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The main things I considered for the user in regard to web based apps were speed, usability, and the GUI in general.  Like they say in cooking, we eat with our eyes first and so the design of the interface and speed of the app are important since the user is just as likely to drop the app altogether and uninstall if it's not appealing or takes too long.  Moreover, without any users there is no income for the client.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In approaching designing software, I started vague and narrowed in my goals.  I think in the future I would have again, put more focus in the beginning stages of design.
