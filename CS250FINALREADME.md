How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Speaking with the users and creating user stories is key to interpreting user needs, but I will also put myself in the place of the user!  For example, in one of my SNHU Travel assignments I looked at the interface and asked myself if I could easily use the slideshow.  I changed the color of the background behind the text as a result of this.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I personally choose to approach developing programs with no specific choices in mind, in order to be as adaptable as possible.  I enjoy Scrum-agile quite a bit, but I prefer to leave myself open to others.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Communication, teamwork, and accountability are imperative in being a good team member.  But moreover, you must not let your ego get in the way so any problems that arise can be solved quickly.
