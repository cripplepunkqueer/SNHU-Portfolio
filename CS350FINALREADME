Milestone One
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  o	I was learning how to utilize Embedded C to make the LED flash
•	What did you do particularly well?
  o	I handled adversity very well!
•	Where could you improve?
  o	Being perhaps slightly more proactive so I have more time to work on things before I have to turn things in late.
•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  o	I love embedded C and find it to be incredibly cool so I will be experimenting with raspberry pi’s in the future!
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  o	Practicing patience as well as exercising how to know when to walk away and take a breather.
•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  o	I did my best to use industry standards, write notes, and be modular with my coding!


Milestone Two
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  o	I was utilizing Embedded C to learn how to make input control the LED’s in my TI board.
•	What did you do particularly well?
  o	Perseverance, definitely.
•	Where could you improve?
  o	I think as in the above, I could have been perhaps a bit more proactive in areas – hindsight is 20/20 unfortunately.
•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  o	As well as above, I will be seeing if I may wish to pursue a career in Embedded C as I did enjoy it!
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  o	See above, but also – the skills I picked up learning something new are always going to be invaluable as keeping my education current and new is going to be incredibly important!
•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  o	I did my best to use industry standards, write notes, and be modular with my coding!
