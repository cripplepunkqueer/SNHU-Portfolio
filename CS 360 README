Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The requirements of this app are to build a functional app that used a database to store events and tasks and a username and password for logging in.  It needs to allow a user to login or sign up usinfg one bvutton that adds them to the database.  There should be options to edit and delete events.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  A login screen, a sign up screen, home were all made - ideally I would add an edit screen, options for daily, weekly, monthly displays of the events as well.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  Truth be told I didn't have the best time trying to code this and ultimately was not able to, but typically I try to do it a little bit over time and work backwards from a need that needed to be filled.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I was missing a HAXM plugin?  Could not find where to install it for the life of  me either so I couldnt do any testing this entire term.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I actually wanted to still see the app come to fruition somehow so I went to Canva to make a mockup of what I had in mind!
