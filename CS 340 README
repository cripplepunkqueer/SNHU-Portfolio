•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    o	As I had some struggles in Projects One and Two with getting the CRUD module to work – I will examine this from a general standpoint.  I do my best to write as much notes as possible, and I am continually developing better skills in doing so as I am sure I have room to improve in terms of where I leave notes.  Using Object-Oriented code means as well that it’s something that is easier to adapt  since everything is separated out into different functions.
•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    o	I have Severe ADHD among other things and so I actually contemplate this on the regular, as part of why I am studying is to learn how to approach problems now so I can have the best foundation in the future for when I approach problems in my future career. 

    As for how I actually approach these things, I have learned an important skill in knowing when it is time to step away and breathe, get my head on straight again, and re-approach the issue with fresh eyes.  What I will use in the future is perhaps seeking out alternate ways of explaining the learning so I might have a better way of understanding.
•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    o	Computer Scientists do so many things!  To explain it all would require more time than we have.  But the way I see it in general is that we help maintain and revolutionize tech that our world depends on.  As more and more time passes, our societies become more and more dependent on technology as a whole, and we need many people in many specialties to maintain, run, and revolutionize that technology to keep up with the demand.  

    Once I have worked out the kinks in my work in this topic, I think my work on this type of project could help a company like Grazioso Salvare because I have a unique viewpoint being neurodivergent.  It means I’m able to recognize patterns incredibly well and I actually have taken a great interest in UI/UX design and could help streamline the process with the Dashboard as well.
